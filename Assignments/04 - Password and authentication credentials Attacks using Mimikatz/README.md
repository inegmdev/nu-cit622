# Assignment#4: üîê Password and authentication credentials Attacks using Mimikatz

## Assignment Details

### What is Mimikatz

Mimikatz is a well-known tool test the security of a system. It is primarily used to extract password hashes, plaintext passwords, and other authentication credentials from a Windows system's memory. The tool is designed to exploit weaknesses in the Windows security model and can be used to escalate privileges and perform other malicious actions.

### How it works

To dump password and credentials, Mimikatz uses a technique called "pass-the-hash." This technique involves extracting password hashes from memory and then using them to authenticate with other systems without the need for the actual password. This means that even if the password is changed, an attacker can still use the hash to authenticate with other systems.

Mimikatz also has the ability to extract plaintext passwords from memory by scanning for them in clear text format. This is possible because Windows often stores passwords in plain text format in memory, making them vulnerable to extraction by tools like Mimikatz.

### What is expected in the assignment?

In this assignment you are asked to do a thoroughly analysis of Mimikatz and how it works. Starts from the Mimikatz source code on Github:

- Compile Mimikatz from source code.
- Run Mimikatz binariy (In a Virtual machine) and monitor the API calls using you user mode hooking tools ( Assignment 3) and/or ProcessExporer/ProcessMonitor.
- Write an analysis report that shows the following:
  - High level outline on how Mimikatz works and what API it calls to access Lsass process
  - How the ‚ÄúPass the hash‚Äù technique works and where in the code this technique is implemented and how it implemented.
  - When you run Mimikatz on a victim virtual machine, what artifacts it leaves behind?
    - What files being dropped on a system?
    - What process is created, and victims process being accessed?
    - Any other important artifacts?

#### Assignment deliverables

- Full and detailed analysis report of min 10 pages and no longer than 20 pages.
